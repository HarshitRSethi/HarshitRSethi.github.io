# Harshit’s Terminal Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive terminal-styled portfolio site!  
I'm Harshit Sethi — a pre-college student about to join IIIT Allahabad (IT '29).

🚀 **Tech Stack**:  
- Git, HTML/CSS, JavaScript  
- Terminal UI design  
- Learning: C++, Competitive Programming, Full Stack Dev, ML

💡 **What this site does**  
This project simulates a terminal interface where you can explore my bio, social links, project plans, and future experiments — all via typed commands.

📂 Commands include: `help`, `whois`, `missions`, `projects`, `email`, `social`, `theme`, and more.
