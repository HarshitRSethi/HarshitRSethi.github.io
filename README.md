# Harshit’s Terminal Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive terminal-styled portfolio site!  
I'm Harshit Sethi — a first year college student at IIIT Allahabad (IT '29).

🚀 **Tech Stack**:

- Git, HTML/CSS, Scratch, C
- Terminal UI design
- Learning: C++ Programming, Full Stack Dev

💡 **What this site does**  
This project simulates a terminal interface where you can explore my social links, project plans, and future experiments — all via typed commands.

📂 Commands include: `help`, `whois`, `missions`, `projects`, `email`, `social`, `theme`, and more.
